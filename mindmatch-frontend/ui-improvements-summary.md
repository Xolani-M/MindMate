# UI Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Error Display Redundancy
**Problem**: Double warning icons and redundant "Login Failed" messages appearing
**Solution**: 
- Removed `showIcon: true` from Alert components in `LoginFeedback.tsx`
- Now uses only custom icons to avoid Ant Design's built-in icon duplication
- Clean, single icon display with clear error messages

### 2. Login Loading State Visibility
**Problem**: "Signing you in" text wasn't visible enough during login process
**Solution**:
- Enhanced loading text styling with larger font size (15px), bold weight (500), and green color (#059669)
- Improved visual hierarchy with better contrast
- Made loading state more prominent and professional

### 3. Session Persistence on Page Refresh
**Problem**: Users getting kicked out when refreshing chat page
**Solution**:
- Added proper authentication check in chat page
- Implemented redirect to login when no valid token is found
- Added loading state while authentication is being verified
- Enhanced auth state management to prevent unnecessary logouts

## Files Modified

### `/src/app/auth/login/LoginFeedback.tsx`
